# Taco-Time

This app utilizes Handlebars, MySQL, Node, Express, and an ORM to create a database menu of tacos to make and devour.

This application follows the MVC design pattern, with Handlebars for HTML design.

## Instructions
1. Type in the name of the taco you want to eat!
    - Upon clicking "Add Taco" your unique taco will be added to the section "EAT A TACO!".
2. Browse the taco selection under "EAT A TACO" and pick the taco that most entices you, and click **nom nom nom** 
    - You will then see the taco eaten up and moved to the "Devoured Tacos" section.
